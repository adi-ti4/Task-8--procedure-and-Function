# Task-8--procedure-and-Function
In SQL, a procedure and a function are both types of stored database programs, but they serve slightly different purposes. 
A stored procedure is a precompiled set of SQL statements that can perform operations such as inserting, updating, or deleting data, and can also include control structures like loops and conditions. Procedures can accept input and output parameters, and they are often used to execute complex business logic or batch processing. A function, on the other hand, is designed to return a single value (scalar function) or a table (table-valued function) based on input parameters. Functions are typically used for computations, data transformations, or retrieving processed results, and they can be used directly in SQL expressions. The key differences are that functions must return a value and cannot perform transactions like INSERT or DELETE in most databases, while procedures can perform a variety of operations and may or may not return a value.
